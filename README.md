# CMPM 121 D1 Project

A simple incremental game where you produce “games” by clicking and buy upgrades to increase production.

Peer Inspired Changes:

I implemented a floating “+1” number popup animation that appears each time the player clicks.
This was inspired by Planet Clicker: <https://github.com/inyoo403/D1.a>

Made the main click button enlarge on mouse hover (and return to normal on mouse out) using a CSS `:hover` transform.\
Inspired by UriosteguiM12’s project: <https://github.com/UriosteguiM12/cmpm-121-f25-d1>
